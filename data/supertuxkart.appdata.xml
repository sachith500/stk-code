  <summary>A racing game</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      SuperTuxKart is a fun 3D kart racing game.
      You can play with up to 4 friends on one PC, racing against each other or
      just try to beat the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      See the great lighthouse or drive through the sand and visit the pyramids.
      Race underground or in space, watching the stars passing by.
      Have some rest under the palms on the beach (watching the other karts
      overtaking you :) ).
      But don't eat the bananas! Watch for bowling balls, plungers, bubble gum
      and cakes thrown by opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of several
      Grand Prix, try to beat the high score in time trials on your own, play
      battle mode against your friends, and more!
